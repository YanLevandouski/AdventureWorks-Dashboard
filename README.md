README - AdventureWorks Dashboard

This dashboard was developed during my studies in the "Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence" course on Udemy.

During the preparation, I loaded the data from CSV files, performed data cleansing, added new calculated and conditional columns via Power Query
and created the data model from scratch.

I also created a separate Measure Table containing DAX calculations and developed four report pages with various types of visualizations, including:
bar charts, KPI cards, tables/matrices, line charts, area charts, maps, and more.

Additionally, I utilized features such as drill up / down / through, page filters, slicers, interactive buttons, and hierarchies during the dashboard development.

The file contains four sheets:

 - "Executive Dashboard"
 - "Map"
 - "Product Details"
 - "Customer Details"
